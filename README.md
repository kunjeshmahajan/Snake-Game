# Snake-Game-Discription
It is our first experience towards game development. In this project we have used the basic library of python to create this game that is pygame..
In this project we have used common library of python that is pygame and I have completed many small project with tkinter  library like 
Alarm Clock,
Email Slicer,
Random password generator,
Simple Calculator etc.

As we have mentioned earlier that it is our first one so to make it perfect we have taken help from online platforms such as google and youtube. By watching videos we get a whole idea to improve this project and add new features in it.
We have imported a song so to make it attractive and laser sounds when the snake eats the food. 
We have used modules to increase the speed of the snake as it eats the food... the more it eats the more speed it gets.
We have also given instructions so to get familiar with modules of pygame. We recommend you to watch that first then move to code.
At last Thank you for referring this and learn more and update more by yourself in the code.
